<h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
<p class="tab"><b>mailx</b> is an intelligent <a href="/jargon/e/email.htm">mail</a> processing system, which has a command <a href="/jargon/s/syntax.htm">syntax</a> reminiscent of <a href="/unix/ued.htm">ed</a> with lines replaced by messages. It is based on <a href="/jargon/b/bsd.htm">Berkeley</a> Mail 8.1, is intended to provide the functionality of the <a href="/unix/umail.htm">mail</a> command, and offers extensions for <a href="/jargon/m/mime.htm">MIME</a>, <a href="/jargon/i/imap.htm">IMAP</a>, <a href="/jargon/p/pop.htm">POP3</a>, <a href="/jargon/s/smtp.htm">SMTP</a>, and <b>S/MIME</b>. <b>mailx</b> provides enhanced features for interactive use, such as <a href="/jargon/c/cache.htm">caching</a> and disconnected operation for IMAP, message threading, scoring, and <a href="/jargon/f/filter.htm">filtering</a>. It is also usable as a mail <a href="/jargon/b/batchfil.htm">batch</a> language, both for sending and receiving mail.</p>

<h2>Sending mail</h2>
<p class="tab">To send a message to one or more people, <b>mailx</b> can be invoked with <a href="/jargon/a/argument.htm">arguments</a> that are the names of people to whom the mail will be sent. The user is then expected to type in his message, followed by an '<b>control-D</b>' at the beginning of a line, which signals the end of the message, and implicit approval to send it.</p>
<h2>Reading mail</h2>
<p class="tab">In normal usage <b>mailx</b> is given no arguments and checks the user's mail out of the mail server, then prints out a one line header of each message found. The current message is initially the first message (numbered <b>1</b>) and can be printed using the <b>print</b> command which can be abbreviated '<b>p</b>'). The user can move among the messages much as he moves between lines in <a href="/unix/ued.htm">ed</a>, with the commands '<b>+</b>' and '<b>-</b>' moving backwards and forwards, and simple numbers.</p>
<h2>Disposing of mail</h2>
<p class="tab">After examining a message the user can <b>delete</b> ('<b>d</b>') the message, or <b>reply</b> '<b>r</b>') to it. Deletion causes the <b>mailx</b> program to forget about the message. This is not irreversible; the message can be <b>undelete</b>d ('<b>u</b>') by giving its number, or the <b>mailx</b> session can be aborted by giving the <b>exit</b> ('<b>x</b>') command. Deleted messages will, however, usually disappear never to be seen again.</p>
<h2>Specifying messages</h2>
<p class="tab">Commands such as <b>print</b> and <b>delete</b> can be given a list of message numbers as arguments to apply to many messages at once. Thus '<b>delete 1 2</b>' deletes messages <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, while '<b>delete 1-5</b>' deletes messages <b>1</b> through <b>5</b>. In sorted or threaded mode (see the <a href="#Sort-Command"><b>sort</b></a> and <a href="#Thread-Command"><b>thread</b></a> commands), '<b>delete 1-5</b>' deletes the messages that are located between (and including) messages <b>1</b> through <b>5</b> in the sorted/threaded order, as shown in the header summary. The following special message names exist:</p>

</table>
<p class="tab">A practical method to read a set of messages is to issue a <b>from</b> command with the search criteria first to check for appropriate messages, and then to read each single message by typing '<b>'</b>' (single quote) repeatedly.</p>
<h2>Replying to or originating mail</h2>
<p class="tab">The <b>reply</b> command can be used to set up a response to a message, sending it back to the sender. Text the user types in then, up to an <a href="/jargon/e/eof.htm">end-of-file</a>, defines the contents of the message. While the user is composing a message, <b>mailx</b> treats lines beginning with the character '<b>~</b>' specially. For instance, typing '<b>~m</b>' (alone on a line) will place a copy of the current message into the response right shifting it by a tabstop (see <b>indentprefix</b> variable, below). Other escapes will set up subject fields, add and delete recipients to the message, <a href="/jargon/a/attachme.htm">attach files</a> to it and allow the user to escape to an editor to revise the message or to a <a href="/jargon/s/shell.htm">shell</a> to run some commands.</p>
<h2>Ending a mail processing session</h2>
<p class="tab">The user can end a <b>mailx</b> session with the quit ('<b>q</b>') command. Messages which have been examined go to the user's mailbox file, unless they have been deleted, in which case they are discarded. Unexamined messages go back to the post office (see the <b>-f</b> option above).</p>
<h2>Personal and systemwide distribution lists</h2>
<p class="tab">It is also possible to create a personal distribution lists so that, for instance, the user can send mail to the word '<b>cohorts</b>' and have it go to a group of people. Such lists can be defined by placing a line like:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="640f160d00080124110706070b161d">[email&#160;protected]</a></pre>
<p class="tab">in the file <b>.mailrc</b> in the user's <a href="/jargon/h/homedir.htm">home directory</a>. The current list of such aliases can be displayed with the <b>alias</b> command in <b>mailx</b>. System wide distribution lists can be created by editing <b>/etc/aliases</b> (see <a href="/unix/usendmai.htm">sendmail</a>); these are kept in a different syntax. In mail the user sends, personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent to others so that they will be able to reply to the recipients. System wide aliases are not expanded when the mail is sent, but any reply returned to the machine has the system wide alias expanded as all mail goes through <b>sendmail</b>.</p>
<h2>Recipient address specifications</h2>
<p class="tab">When an address is used to name a recipient (in any of <b>To</b>, <b>Cc</b>, or <b>Bcc</b>), names of local mail folders and pipes to external commands can also be specified; the message text is then written to them. The rules are: Any name which starts with a '<b>|</b>' character specifies a pipe, the command string following the '<b>|</b>' is executed and the message is sent to its standard input; any other name which contains a '<b>@</b>' character is treated as a mail address; any other name which starts with a '<b>+</b>' character specifies a folder name; any other name which contains a '<b>/</b>' character but no '<b>!</b>' or '<b>%</b>' character before also specifies a folder name; what remains is treated as a mail address. Compressed folders are handled as described for the folder command below.</p>
<h2>MIME types</h2>
<p class="tab">For any outgoing attachment, <b>mailx</b> tries to determine the content type. It does this by reading <a href="/jargon/m/mime.htm">MIME</a> type files whose lines have the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">type/subtype extension [extension . . .]</pre>
<p class="tab">where <i>type</i><b>/</b><i>subtype</i> are strings describing the file contents, and <i>extension</i> is the part of a filename starting after the last dot. Any line not immediately beginning with an <a href="/jargon/a/ascii.htm">ASCII</a> alphabetical character is ignored by <b>mailx</b>. If there is a match with the extension of the file to attach, the given type/subtype pair is used. Otherwise, or if the filename has no extension, the content types <b>text/plain</b> or <b>application/octet-stream</b> are used, the first for text or international text files, the second for any file that contains formatting characters other than <a href="/jargon/n/newline.htm">newlines</a> and horizontal tabs.</p>
<h2>Character sets</h2>
<p class="tab"><b>mailx</b> normally detects the character set of the <a href="/jargon/t/terminal.htm">terminal</a> using the <b>LC_CTYPE</b> locale setting. If the locale cannot be used appropriately, the <b>ttycharset</b> variable should be set to provide an explicit value. When reading messages, their text is converted to the terminal character set if possible. Unprintable characters and illegal byte sequences are detected and replaced by <a href="/jargon/u/unicode.htm">Unicode</a> substitute characters or question marks ("<b>?</b>") unless the <b>print-all-chars</b> option is set at initialization time.</p>
<p class="tab">The character set for outgoing messages is not necessarily the same as the one used on the terminal. If an outgoing text message contains characters not representable in US-ASCII, the character set being used must be declared within its header. Permissible values can be declared using the <b>sendcharsets</b> variable, separated by commas; <b>mailx</b> tries each of the values in order and uses the first appropriate one. If the message contains characters that cannot be represented in any of the given character sets, the message will not be sent, and its text will be saved to the '<b>dead.letter</b>' file. Messages that contain <a href="/jargon/n/nullchar.htm">NUL</a> bytes are not converted.</p>
<p class="tab">Outgoing attachments are converted if they are plain text. If the <b>sendcharsets</b> variable contains more than one character set name, the <b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dba59b">[email&#160;protected]</a></b> <a href="#Tilde-Escapes">tilde escape</a> will ask for the character sets for individual attachments if it is invoked without arguments.</p>
<p class="tab">Best results are usually achieved when <b>mailx</b> is run in a UTF-8 locale on a UTF-8 capable terminal. In this setup, characters from various countries can be displayed, while it is still possible to use more simple character sets for sending to retain maximum compatibility with older mail clients.</p>
<h2>Commands</h2>
<p class="tab">Each command is typed on a line by itself, and may take arguments following the command word. The command need not be typed in its entirety - the first command which matches the typed prefix is used. For commands which take message lists as arguments, if no message list is given, then the next message forward which satisfies the command's requirements is used. If there are no messages forward of the current message, the search proceeds backwards, and if there are no good messages at all, <b>mailx</b> types 'applicable messages' and aborts the command. If the command begins with a <b>#</b> sign, the line is ignored.</p>
<p class="tab">The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>An argument can be enclosed between paired double-quotes <b>" "</b> or single-quotes <b>' '</b>; any white space, shell word expansion, or backslash characters in the quotes are treated literally as part of the argument. A double-quote will be treated literally within single-quotes and vice versa. These special properties of the quote marks occur only when they are paired at the beginning and end of the argument.</li>
<li>A backslash outside of the enclosing quotes is discarded and the following character is treated literally as part of the argument.</li>
<li>An unquoted backslash at the end of a command line is discarded and the next line continues the command.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tab">Filenames, where expected, are subjected to the following transformations, in sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the filename begins with an unquoted plus sign, and the <b>folder</b> variable is defined, the plus sign will be replaced by the value of the folder variable followed by a slash. If the <b>folder</b> variable is unset or is set to <a href="/jargon/n/null.htm">null</a>, the filename will be unchanged.</li>
<li>Shell word expansions are applied to the filename. If more than a single pathname results from this expansion and the command is expecting one file, an error results.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tab">The following commands are provided:</p>

<p class="tab">The <b>mailx</b> command has two distinct usages, according to whether one wants to send or receive mail. Sending mail is simple: to send a message to a user whose e-mail address is, say, <b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="74161d181834110c15190418115a171b19">[email&#160;protected]</a></b>, use the <a href="/jargon/s/shell.htm">shell</a> command</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">mailx <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fa98939696ba9f829b978a969fd4999597">[email&#160;protected]</a></pre>
<p class="tab">and then type your message. <b>Mailx</b> will prompt you for a message subject first; after that, lines typed by you form the body of the message. When you reach the end of the message, type an End Of Transmission character (<b>control-d</b>) at the beginning of a line, which will cause <b>mailx</b> to echo '<b>EOT</b>' and return you to the shell.</p>
<p class="tab">If, while you are composing the message you decide that you do not wish to send it after all, you can abort the letter with a <b>RUBOUT</b> (<b>control-c</b>). Typing a single <b>RUBOUT</b> causes <b>mailx</b> to print '<b>(Interrupt -- one more to kill letter)</b>'. Typing a second <b>RUBOUT</b> causes <b>mailx</b> to save your partial letter on the file '<b>dead.letter</b>' in your home directory and abort the letter. Once you have sent mail to someone, there is no way to undo the send.</p>
<p class="tab">If you want to send the same message to other people, you can list their e-mail addresses on the command line, like this:</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">mailx <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6013010d200518010d100c054e030f0d">[email&#160;protected]</a> <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aeccc1cceeddcbdcd8cbdc80c0cfc3cb">[email&#160;protected]</a></pre>

<p class="tab">To read your mail, at the command line, enter:</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">mailx</pre>
<p class="tab"><b>Mailx</b> will respond by typing its version number and date and then listing the messages you have waiting. Then it will type a prompt and await your command. The messages are assigned numbers starting with <b>1</b>, and later you will refer to the messages with these numbers. <b>Mailx</b> keeps track of which messages are new (have been sent since you last read your mail) and read (have been read by you). New messages have an <b>N</b> next to them in the header listing and old, but unread messages have a <b>U</b> next to them. <b>Mailx</b> keeps track of new/old and read/unread messages by putting a header field called <b>Status</b> into your messages.</p>
<p class="tab">To look at a specific message, use the <b>type</b> command, which may be abbreviated to <b>t</b>. For example, if you had the following messages:</p>
<pre class="tab">O 1 <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b5d1c7d3dadaf5d8ccdddac6c19bd0cdd4d8c5d9d0">[email&#160;protected]</a> Wed Sep 1 19:52 18/631 "Fees"

<p class="tab">you could examine the first message by giving <b>mailx</b> the command:</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">type 1</pre>
<p class="tab">which might cause it to respond with, for example:</p>
<pre class="tab">Message 1:

<p class="tab">Many <b>mailx</b> commands that operate on messages take a message number as an argument like the <b>type</b> command. For these commands, there is a notion of a current message. When you enter the <b>mailx</b> program, the current message is initially the first (or the first recent) one. Thus, you can often omit the message number and use, for example,</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">t</pre>
<p class="tab">to type the current message. As a further shorthand, you can type a message by giving its message number. Hence,</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">1</pre>
<p class="tab">would type the first message.</p>
<p class="tab">Frequently, it is useful to read the messages in your mailbox in order, one after another. You can read the next message in <b>mailx</b> by typing a <a href="/jargon/n/newline.htm">newline</a>. As a special case, you can type a newline as your first command to <b>mailx</b> to type the first message.</p>
<p class="tab">If, after typing a message, you want to immediately send a reply, you can do so with the <b>reply</b> command. This command, like <b>type</b>, takes a message number as an <a href="/jargon/a/argument.htm">argument</a>. <b>mailx</b> then begins a message addressed to the user who sent you the message. You may then type in your letter in reply, followed by <b>control-d</b> at the beginning of a line, as before.</p>
<p class="tab">Note that <b>mailx</b> copies the subject header from the original message. This is useful in that correspondence about a particular matter will tend to retain the same subject heading, making it easy to recognize. If there are other header fields in the message, like '<b>Cc:</b>', the information found will also be used.</p>
<p class="tab">Sometimes you will receive a message that was sent to several people and wish to reply only to the person who sent it. Reply with a capital <b>R</b> replies to a message, but sends a copy to the sender only.</p>
<p class="tab">If you want, while reading your mail, to send a message to someone, but not as a reply to one of your messages, you can send the message directly with the <b>mail</b> command, which takes as arguments the names of the recipients you want to send to. For example, to send a message to <b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aec8dccfc0c5eec3cfcdc6c7c0cb80cbd6cfc3dec2cb">[email&#160;protected]</a></b>, you enter the following from within <b>mailx</b>:</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">mail <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7e180c1f10153e131f1d1617101b501b061f130e121b">[email&#160;protected]</a></pre>
<p class="tab">To delete a message from the mail folder, you can use the <b>delete</b> command. In addition to not saving deleted messages, <b>mailx</b> will not let you type them, either. The effect is to make the message disappear altogether, along with its number.</p>
<p class="tab">Many features of <b>mailx</b> can be tailored to your liking with the <b>set</b> command. The <b>set</b> command has two forms, depending on whether you are setting a binary option or a valued option. Binary options are either <b>on</b> or <b>off</b>. For example, the <b>askcc</b> option informs <b>mailx</b> that each time you send a message, you want it to prompt you for a '<b>Cc:</b>' header, to be included in the message. To set the <b>askcc</b> option, you would type</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">set askcc</pre>
<p class="tab">Valued options are values which <b>mailx</b> uses to adapt to your tastes. For example, the <b>record</b> option tells <b>mailx</b> where to save messages sent by you, and is specified by</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">set record=Sent</pre>
<p class="tab">for example. Note that no spaces are allowed in <b>record=Sent</b>.</p>
<p class="tab"><b>Mailx</b> includes a simple facility for maintaining groups of messages together in folders. To use the folder facility, you must tell <b>mailx</b> where you want to keep your folders. Each folder of messages will be a single file. For convenience, all of your folders are kept in a single directory of your choosing. To tell <b>mailx</b> where your folder directory is, put a line of the form</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">set folder=letters</pre>
<p class="tab">in your <b>.mailrc</b> file. If, as in the example above, your folder directory does not begin with a '<b>/</b>', <b>mailx</b> will assume that your folder directory is to be found starting from your home directory.</p>
<p class="tab">Anywhere a file name is expected, you can use a folder name, preceded with '<b>+</b>'. For example, to put a message into a folder with the <b>save</b> command, you can use:</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">save +classwork</pre>
<p class="tab">to save the current message in the <b>classwork</b> folder. If the <b>classwork</b> folder does not yet exist, it will be created. Note that messages that are saved with the <b>save</b> command are automatically removed from your system mailbox.</p>
<p class="tab">To make a copy of a message in a folder without causing that message to be removed from your system mailbox, use the <b>copy</b> command, which is identical in all other respects to the <b>save</b> command.</p>
<p class="tab">The <b>folder</b> command can be used to direct <b>mailx</b> to the contents of a different folder. For example,</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">folder +classwork</pre>
<p class="tab">directs <b>mailx</b> to read the contents of the <b>classwork</b> folder. All of the commands that you can use on your system mailbox are also applicable to folders, including <b>type</b>, <b>delete</b>, and <b>reply</b>. To inquire which folder you are currently editing, use:</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">folder</pre>
<p class="tab">To list your current set of folders, use the <b>folders</b> command.</p>
<p class="tab">Finally, the <b>help</b> command is available to print out a brief summary of the most important <b>mailx</b> commands.</p>
<p class="tab">While typing in a message to be sent to others, it is often useful to be able to invoke the text editor on the partial message, print the message, execute a shell command, or do some other auxiliary function. <b>Mailx</b> provides these capabilities through <a href="#Tilde-Escapes">tilde escapes</a>, which consist of a tilde (<b>~</b>) at the beginning of a line, followed by a single character which indicates the function to be performed. For example, to print the text of the message so far, use:</p>
<pre class="tcy tab">~p</pre>
<p class="tab">which will print a line of dashes, the recipients of your message, and the text of the message so far. A list of the most important tilde escapes is available by typing '<b>~?</b>'.</p>
