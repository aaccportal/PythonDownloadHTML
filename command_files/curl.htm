<td>(<b>FTP</b>/<b>SFTP</b>) When used in an FTP <a href="/jargon/u/upload.htm">upload</a>, this will tell <b>curl</b> to append to the target file instead of <a href="/jargon/o/overwrit.htm">overwriting</a> it. If the file doesn't exist, it is created.<br><br>Note that this option is ignored by some SSH servers, including OpenSSH.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-A</b>, <b>--user-agent</b> <i>&lt;agent string&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Specify the <a href="/jargon/u/useragen.htm">User-Agent</a> <a href="/jargon/s/string.htm">string</a> to send to the HTTP server. Some <a href="/jargon/c/cgi.htm">CGI</a> fail if the agent string is not set to "<b>Mozilla/4.0</b>". To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single quote marks.<br><br>This value can also be set with the <b>-H</b>/<b>--header</b> option.<br><br>If this option is set more than once, the last one will be the one that's used.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--anyauth</b></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Tells <b>curl</b> to figure out <a href="/jargon/a/auth.htm">authentication</a> method by itself, and use the most secure method the remote site claims it supports. This is done by first making a request and checking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing a network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a specific authentication method, which you can do with <b>--basic</b>, <b>--digest</b>, <b>--ntlm</b>, and <b>--negotiate</b>.<br><br>Note that using <b>--anyauth</b> is not recommended if you do <a href="/jargon/u/upload.htm">uploads</a> from <a href="/jargon/s/stdin.htm">stdin</a> since it may require data to be sent twice and then the client must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload operation fails.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-b</b>, <b>--cookie</b> <i>&lt;name</i><b>=</b><i>data&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a <a href="/jargon/c/cookie.htm">cookie</a>. It is expected to be the data previously received from the server in a "<b>Set-Cookie:</b>" line. The data should be in the format "<b>NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2</b>".<br><br>If no '<b>=</b>' (equals) <a href="/jargon/c/charact.htm">character</a> is used in the line, it is treated as a <a href="/jargon/f/filename.htm">file name</a> to use to read previously stored cookie lines from, which should be used in this session if they match. Using this method also activates the "cookie parser" which makes curl record incoming cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this in combination with the <b>--location</b> option. The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP <a href="/jargon/h/header.htm">headers</a> or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> the file specified with <b>-b</b>/<b>--cookie</b> is only used as <a href="/jargon/i/input.htm">input</a>. No cookies will be stored in the file. To store cookies, use the <b>-c</b>/<b>--cookie-jar</b> option, or you can save the HTTP headers to a file using <b>-D</b>/<b>--dump-header</b>.<br><br>If this option is set more than once, the last occurrence will be the option that's used.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-B</b>, <b>--use-ascii</b></td>
<td>(<b>FTP/LDAP</b>) Enable ASCII transfer. For <b>FTP</b>, this can also be enforced using an URL that ends with "<b>;Type=A</b>". This option causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for <a href="/jargon/w/win32.htm">win32</a> systems.<br><br>If this option is used twice, the second one disables ASCII usage.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--basic</b></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Tells <b>curl</b> to use HTTP Basic authentication. This is the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use it to override a previously set option that sets a different authentication method (such as <b>--ntlm</b>, <b>--digest</b> and <b>--negotiate</b>).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--ciphers</b> <i>&lt;list of ciphers&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>SSL</b>) Specifies which <a href="/jargon/c/cipher.htm">ciphers</a> to use in the connection. The ciphers listed must be valid. You can read up on <a href="/jargon/s/ssl.htm">SSL</a> cipher list details at <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/apps/ciphers.html" class="external">openssl.org</a>.<br><br>NSS ciphers are done differently than OpenSSL and GnuTLS. The full list of NSS ciphers is in the NSSCipherSuite entry at this URL: <a href="https://pagure.io/mod_nss#Directives" class="external">https://pagure.io/mod_nss#Directives</a>.<br><br>If this option is used several times, the last one overrides the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--compressed</b></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Request a <a href="/jargon/c/compress.htm">compressed</a> response using one of the <a href="/jargon/a/algorith.htm">algorithms</a> <b>curl</b> supports, and return the uncompressed document. If this option is used and the server sends an unsupported <a href="/jargon/e/encode.htm">encoding</a>, Curl will report an error.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--connect-timeout</b> <i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></td>
<td>Maximum time in seconds that the connection to the server may take. This only limits the connection phase; once curl has connected this option no longer applies. Since 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values, but the actual timeout decreases in accuracy as the specified timeout increases in decimal precision. See also the <b>-m</b>/<b>--max-time</b> option.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-c</b>, <b>--cookie-jar</b> <i>&lt;file name&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Specify what file you want <b>curl</b> to write all cookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified file and all cookies received from remote server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be written. The file will be written using the <a href="/jargon/n/netscape.htm">Netscape</a> cookie file format. If you set the file name to a single dash ("<b>-</b>"), the cookies will be written to stdout.<br><br> This command line option activates the cookie engine that makes <b>curl</b> record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is to use the <b>-b</b>/<b>--cookie option</b>.<br><br> <b>NOTE:</b> If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl operation won't fail or even report an error. If <b>-v</b> is specified a warning is displayed, but that is the only visible feedback you get about this possibly fatal situation.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the last specified file name will be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-C</b>, <b>--continue-at</b> <i>&lt;offset&gt;</i></td>
<td>Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given <i><a href="/jargon/o/offset.htm">offset</a></i>. The given offset is the exact number of <a href="/jargon/b/byte.htm">bytes</a> that will be skipped, counted from the beginning of the source file before it is transferred to the destination. If used with uploads, the ftp server command SIZE is not used by curl.<br><br> Use "<b>-C -</b>" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses the given output/input files to figure that out.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--create-dirs</b></td>
<td>When used in conjunction with the <b>-o</b> option, <b>curl</b> creates the necessary local <a href="/jargon/d/director.htm">directory</a> <a href="/jargon/h/hierfile.htm">hierarchy</a> as needed. This option creates the dirs mentioned with the <b>-o</b> option, nothing else. If the <b>-o</b> file name uses no directory or if the directories it mentions already exist, no directories are created.<br><br> To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try <b>--ftp-create-dirs</b>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--crlf</b></td>
<td>(<b>FTP</b>) Convert <b><a href="/jargon/l/lf.htm">LF</a></b> to <b><a href="/jargon/c/cr.htm">CRLF</a></b> in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--crlfile</b> <i>&lt;file&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTPS/FTPS</b>) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revocation List that may specify peer certificates that are to be considered revoked.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.<br><br> (Added in 7.19.7)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-d</b>, <b>--data</b> <i>&lt;data&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Sends the specified data in a <b>POST</b> request to the HTTP server, in a way that emulates as if a user has filled in an HTML <a href="/jargon/f/form.htm">form</a> and pressed the submit button. Note that the data is sent exactly as specified with no extra processing (with all <a href="/jargon/n/newline.htm">newlines</a> cut off). The data is expected to be "url-encoded". This causes <b>curl</b> to pass the data to the server using the content-type <b>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</b>. Compare to <b>-F</b>/<b>--form</b>. If this option is used more than once on the same <a href="/jargon/c/commandi.htm">command line</a>, the data pieces specified will be merged together with a separating "<b>&amp;</b>" character. Thus, using <b>'-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy'</b> would generate a POST chunk that looks like <b>'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'</b>.<br><br> If you start the data with the "<b>@</b>" character, the rest should be a file name to read the data from, or "<b>-</b>" (dash) if you want curl to read the data from stdin. The contents of the file must already be url-encoded. Multiple files can also be specified. Posting data from a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with "<b>--data @foo-bar</b>".<br><br> <b>-d</b>/<b>--data</b> is the same as <b>--data-ascii</b>. To post data purely <a href="/jargon/b/binary.htm">binary</a>, use the <b>--data-binary</b> option. To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use <b>--data-urlencode</b>.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--data-ascii</b> <i>&lt;data&gt;</i></td>

<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--data-binary</b> <i>&lt;data&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra processing whatsoever.<br><br> If you start the data with the character <b>@</b>, the rest should be a filename. Data is posted in a similar manner as <b>--data-ascii</b> does, except that newlines are preserved and conversions are never done.<br> If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data as described in <b>-d</b>, <b>--data</b>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--data-urlencode</b> <i>&lt;data&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) This posts data, similar to the other --data options with the exception that this performs URL-encoding. (Added in 7.18.0)<br><br> To be CGI-compliant, the <i>&lt;data&gt;</i> part should begin with a name followed by a separator and a content specification. The <i>&lt;data&gt;</i> part can be passed to <b>curl</b> using one of the following syntaxes:<br><br> <b>content</b><br><br> This makes curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. Just be careful so that the content doesn't contain any <b>=</b> or <b>@</b> symbols, as that will then make the syntax match one of the other cases below!<br><br> <b>=content</b><br><br> This makes curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. The preceding <b>=</b> symbol is not included in the data.<br><br> <b>name=content</b><br><br> This makes curl URL-encode the content part and pass that on. Note that the name part is expected to be URL-encoded already.<br><br> <b>@filename</b><br><br> This makes curl load data from the given file (including any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST.<br><br> <b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cba5aaa6ae8bada2a7aea5aaa6ae">[email&#160;protected]</a></b><br><br> This makes curl load data from the given file (including any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST. The name part gets an equal sign appended, resulting in <b>name=urlencoded-file-content</b>. Note that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.</td>

<td><b>--digest</b></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authentication that prevents the <a href="/jargon/p/password.htm">password</a> from being sent as clear text. Use this in combination with the normal <b>-u</b>/<b>--user</b> option to set <a href="/jargon/u/username.htm">username</a> and password. See also <b>--ntlm</b>, <b>--negotiate</b> and <b>--anyauth</b> for related options.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--disable-eprt</b></td>
<td>(<b>FTP</b>) Tell <b>curl</b> to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this option, it uses PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are extensions to the original FTP protocol, may not work on all servers but enable more functionality in a better way than the traditional PORT command.<br><br> <b>--eprt</b> can explicitly enable EPRT again and <b>--no-eprt</b> is an alias for <b>--disable-eprt</b>.<br><br> Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want to switch to passive mode you need to not use <b>-P</b>, <b>--ftp-port</b> or force it with <b>--ftp-pasv</b>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--disable-epsv</b></td>
<td>(<b>FTP</b>) Tell <b>curl</b> to disable the use of the EPSV command when doing passive FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not try using EPSV.<br><br> <b>--epsv</b> can explicitly enable EPSV again and <b>--no-epsv</b> is an alias for <b>--disable-epsv</b>.<br><br> Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior.

<td>Write the protocol headers to the specified file.<br><br> This option is handy to use when you want to store the headers that an HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from the headers could then be read in a second <b>curl</b> invoke using the <b>-b</b>/<b>--cookie</b> option. However, the <b>-c</b>/<b>--cookie-jar</b> option is a better way to store cookies.<br><br> When used on FTP, the ftp server response lines are considered being "headers" and thus are saved there.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the last one is used.</td>

<td><b>-e</b>, <b>--referer</b> <i>&lt;URL&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also be set with the <b>-H</b>/<b>--header</b>. When used with <b>-L</b>/<b>--location</b>, you can append "<b>;auto</b>" to the <b>--referer</b> <a href="/jargon/u/url.htm">URL</a> to make <b>curl</b> automatically set the previous URL when it follows a <b>Location:</b> header. The "<b>;auto</b>" string can be used alone, even if you don't set an initial <b>--referer</b>.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</td>

<td>(<b>SSL</b>) Tells <b>curl</b> to use the specified client certificate file when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based protocol. The certificate must be in PEM format. If the optional password isn't specified, it will be queried for on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a "certificate" file that is the private key and the private certificate concatenated. See <b>--cert</b> and <b>--key</b> to specify them independently.<br><br> If <b>curl</b> is built against the NSS SSL library then this option can tell <b>curl</b> the nickname of the certificate to use in the NSS database defined by the environment variable <b>SSL_DIR</b> (or by default <b>/etc/pki/nssdb</b>). If the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be loaded. If you want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it with "<b>./</b>" prefix, to avoid confusion with a nickname. If the nickname contains "<b>:</b>", it needs to be preceded by "<b>\</b>" so that it is not recognized as password delimiter. If the nickname contains "<b>\</b>", it needs to be escaped as "<b>\\</b>" so that it is not recognized as an escape character.<br><br> (<b>iOS and Mac OS X only</b>) If <b>curl</b> is built against Secure Transport, then the certificate string must match the name of a certificate that's in the system or user keychain. The private key corresponding to the certificate, and certificate chain (if any), must also be present in the keychain.<br><br> If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.</td>

<td><b>-f</b>, <b>--fail</b></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly done to better enable scripts, etc. to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating so (which often also describes why). This flag prevents <b>curl</b> from outputting that and return error 22.<br><br> This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-successful response codes will slip through, especially when authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).</td>

<td><b>-F</b>, <b>--form</b> <i>&lt;name=content&gt;</i></td>
<td>(<b>HTTP</b>) This lets <b>curl</b> emulate a filled-in form where a user has pressed the submit button.

To get the content part of a file, prefix the file name with the letter "<b>&lt;</b>". The difference between "<b>@</b>" and "<b>&lt;</b>" is that <b>@</b> makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the <b>&lt;</b> makes a text <a href="/jargon/f/field.htm">field</a> and gets the contents for that text field from a file.<br><br> For example, to send your password file to the server, where 'password' is the name of the form-field that /etc/passwd is the input:<br><br> <b>curl -F <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ea9a8b99999d85988ed7aa">[email&#160;protected]</a>/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com</b><br><br> To read the file's content from stdin instead of a file, use "<b>-</b>" where the file name should've been.

<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p class="tab">The <a href="/jargon/u/url.htm">URL</a> <a href="/jargon/s/syntax.htm">syntax</a> is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed description in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt" class="external">RFC 3986</a>.</p>
<p class="tab">You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in:</p>
<p class="tabb">http://site.{one,two,three}.com</p>
<p class="tab">or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series using <b>[]</b> as in:</p>
<p class="tabb">ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt<br> ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt<br> ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt</p>
<p class="tab">Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each other:</p>
<p class="tabb">http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html</p>
<p class="tab">You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They are fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.</p>
<p class="tab">You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or letter:</p>
<p class="tabb">http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt<br> http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt</p>
<p class="tab">If you specify URL without <b>protocol://</b> prefix, <b>curl</b> attempts to guess what protocol you might want. It then defaults to HTTP but try other protocols based on often-used hostname prefixes. For example, for hostnames starting with "ftp." <b>curl</b> assumes you want to speak FTP.</p>
<p class="tab"><b>curl</b> does its best to use what you pass to it as a URL. It is not trying to validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but is instead very liberal with what it accepts.</p>
<p class="tab"><b>curl</b> attempts to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so that getting many files from the same server does not do multiple connects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course, this is only done on files specified on a single command line and cannot be used between separate <b>curl</b> invokes.</p>
<h2 id="progress-meter">Progress meter</h2>
<p class="tab"><b>curl</b> normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time left, etc.</p>
<p class="tab"><b>curl</b> displays this data to the <a href="/jargon/t/terminal.htm">terminal</a> by default, so if you invoke <b>curl</b> to do an operation and it is about to <a href="/jargon/w/write.htm">write</a> <a href="/jargon/d/data.htm">data</a> to the terminal, it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output mixing progress meter and response data.</p>
<p class="tab">If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to redirect the response output to a file, using <a href="/jargon/s/shell.htm">shell</a> redirect (<b>&gt;</b>), <b>-o</b> <i>[file]</i> or similar.</p>
<p class="tab">It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit out any response data to the terminal.</p>
