<h2 id="summary-display">Summary display</h2>
<p class="tab">Each of the following areas are individually controlled through interactive commands.</p>
<h3 class="tab">Uptime and Load Averages</h3>
<p class="tab">This section consists of a single line displaying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>program or window name, depending on display mode</li>
<li>current time and length of time since last boot</li>
<li>total number of users</li>
<li>system <a href="/jargon/l/load.htm">load</a> avg over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="tab">Task and CPU States</h3>
<p class="tab">This section consists of a minimum of two lines. In an SMP environment, additional lines can reflect individual CPU state percentages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1 shows total tasks or threads, depending on the state of the Threads-mode toggle. That total is further classified as: <b>running</b>; <b>sleeping</b>; <b>stopped</b>; <b>zombie</b></li>
<li>Line 2 shows CPU state percentages based on the interval since the last refresh. Where two labels are shown below, those for more recent kernel versions are shown first:<br><br><b>us, user</b> : time running un-niced user processes<br><b>sy, system</b> : time running kernel processes<br><b>ni, nice</b> : time running niced user processes<br><b>wa, IO-wait</b> : time waiting for I/O completion<br><b>hi</b> : time spent servicing hardware interrupts<br><b>si</b> : time spent servicing software interrupts<br><b>st</b> : time stolen from this vm by the hypervisor</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="tab">Memory Usage</h3>
<p class="tab">This portion consists of two lines which may express values in kibibytes (KiB), mebibytes (MiB) or gibibytes (GiB) depending on the amount of <a href="/jargon/r/ram.htm">physical memory</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1 reflects physical memory, classified as: <b>total</b>, <b>used</b>, <b>free</b>, <b>buffers</b></li>
<li>Line 2 reflects virtual memory, classified as: <b>total</b>, <b>used</b>, <b>free</b>, <b>cached</b></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fields-columns">Fields / columns</h2>
<p class="tab">Listed below are top's available process fields (columns). They are shown in alphabetical order. You may customize their position and whether or not they are displayable with the '<b>f</b>' or '<b>F</b>' (Fields Management) interactive commands.</p>
<p class="tab">Any field is selectable as the sort field, and you control whether they are sorted high-to-low or low-to-high.</p>
<h3 class="tab">CGROUPS -- Control Groups</h3>
<p class="tab">The names of the control group(s) that a process belongs to, or '<b>-</b>' if not applicable for that process.</p>
<p class="tab">Control Groups provide for allocating resources (cpu, memory, network bandwidth, etc.) among installation-defined groups of processes. They enable fine-grained control over allocating, denying, prioritizing, managing and monitoring those resources.</p>
<p class="tab">Many different hierarchies of &quot;cgroups&quot; can exist simultaneously on a system and each hierarchy is attached to one or more subsystems. A subsystem represents a single resource.</p>
<div class="tip tab" role="note">
<span class="title note">Note</span>
<p>The 'CGROUPS' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width. When displayed, it and any other variable width columns are allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 characters).</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li><b>CODE</b> -- Code Size (KiB). The amount of physical memory devoted to executable code, also known as the 'text resident set' size or TRS.</li>
<li><b>COMMAND</b> -- Command Name or Command Line. Display the command line used to start a task or the name of the associated program. You toggle between command line and name with '<b>c</b>', which is both a command-line option and an interactive command. When you've chosen to display command lines, processes without a command line (like kernel threads) are shown with only the program name in brackets (for example: &quot;<b>[ mrecoveryd ]</b>&quot;). Either form of display is subject to potential truncation if it's too long to fit in this field's current width. That width depends upon other fields selected, their order and the current screen width. This field may also be impacted by the 'forest view' display mode. See the '<b>V</b>' interactive command for additional information regarding that mode.<br><br> Note: The 'COMMAND' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width. When displayed, it and any other variable width columns are allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 characters).</li>
<li><b>%CPU</b> -- CPU Usage. The task's share of the elapsed CPU time since the last screen update, expressed as a percentage of total CPU time. In a true SMP environment, if 'IRIX mode' is Off, top operates in 'Solaris mode' where a task's cpu usage is divided by the total number of CPUs. You toggle 'IRIX/Solaris' modes with the '<b>I</b>' interactive command.</li>
<li><b>DATA</b> -- Data + Stack Size (KiB). The amount of physical memory devoted to other than executable code, also known as the 'data resident set' size or DRS.</li>
<li><b>Flags</b> -- Task Flags. This column represents the task's current scheduling flags that are expressed in hexadecimal notation and with zeros suppressed. These flags are officially documented in &lt;linux/sched.h&gt;.</li>
<li><b>GID</b> -- Group Id. The effective group ID.</li>
<li><b>GROUP</b> -- Group Name. The effective group name.</li>
<li><b>%MEM</b> -- Memory Usage (RES). A task's currently used share of available physical memory.</li>
<li><b>NI</b> -- Nice Value. The nice value of the task. A negative nice value means higher priority, whereas a positive nice value means lower priority. Zero in this field means priority is not adjusted in determining a task's dispatchability.</li>
<li><b>nDRT</b> -- Dirty Pages Count. The number of pages that were modified since they were last written to auxiliary storage. Dirty pages must be written to auxiliary storage before the corresponding physical memory location can be used for some other virtual page.</li>
<li><b>nMaj</b> -- Major Page Fault Count. The number of major page faults that have occurred for a task. A page fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or write to a virtual page that is not currently present in its address space. A major page fault is when auxiliary storage access is involved in making that page available.</li>
<li><b>nMin</b> -- Minor Page Fault count. The number of minor page faults that have occurred for a task. A page fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or write to a virtual page that is not currently present in its address space. A minor page fault does not involve auxiliary storage access in making that page available.</li>
<li><b>nTH</b> -- Number of Threads. The number of threads associated with a process.</li>
<li><b>P</b> -- Last used CPU (SMP). A number representing the last used processor. In a true SMP environment, this likely changes frequently since the kernel intentionally uses weak affinity. Also, the very act of running top may break this weak affinity and cause more processes to change CPUs more often (because of the extra demand for cpu time).</li>
<li><b>PGRP</b> -- Process Group Id. Every process is member of a unique process group that is used for distribution of signals and by terminals to arbitrate requests for their input and output. When a process is created (forked), it becomes a member of the process group of its parent. By convention, this value equals the process ID (see PID) of the first member of a process group, called the process group leader.</li>
<li><b>PID</b> -- Process Id. The task's unique process ID, which periodically wraps, though never restarting at zero. In kernel terms, it is a dispatchable entity defined by a 'task_struct'.<br><br> This value may also be used as: a process group ID (see PGRP); a session ID for the session leader (see SID); a thread group ID for the thread group leader (see TGID); and a TTY process group ID for the process group leader (see TPGID).</li>
<li><b>PPID</b> -- Parent Process Id. The process ID (pid) of a task's parent.</li>
<li><b>PR</b> -- Priority. The scheduling priority of the task. If you see 'rt' in this field, it means the task is running under 'real time' scheduling priority.<br><br> Under linux, real time priority is somewhat misleading since traditionally the operating itself was not preemptable. And while the 2.6 kernel can be made mostly preemptable, it is not always so.</li>
<li><b>RES</b> -- Resident Memory Size (KiB). The non-swapped physical memory a task has used.</li>
<li><b>RUID</b> -- Real User Id.</li>
<li><b>RUSER</b> -- Real Username.</li>
<li><b>S</b> -- Process Status. The status of the task which can be one of:<br><br> '<b>D</b>' = uninterruptible sleep<br> '<b>R</b>' = running<br> '<b>S</b>' = sleeping<br> '<b>T</b>' = traced or stopped<br> '<b>Z</b>' = zombie<br><br> Tasks shown as running should be more properly thought of as 'ready to run' -- their task_struct is represented on the Linux run-queue. Even without a true SMP machine, you may see numerous tasks in this state depending on top's delay interval and nice value.</li>
<li><b>SHR</b> -- Shared Memory Size (KiB). The amount of shared memory available to a task, that often is not all resident. It reflects memory that could be potentially shared with other processes.</li>
<li><b>SID</b> -- Session Id. A session is a collection of process groups (see PGRP), usually established by the login shell. A newly forked process joins the session of its creator. By convention, this value equals the process ID (see PID) of the first member of the session, called the session leader, which is usually the login shell.</li>
<li><b>SUID</b> -- Saved User Id. The saved user ID.</li>
<li><b>SUPGIDS</b> -- Supplementary Group IDs. The IDs of any supplementary group(s) established at login or inherited from a task's parent. They are displayed in a comma delimited list.<br><br> Note: The 'SUPGIDS' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width. When displayed, it and any other variable width columns are allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 characters).</li>
<li><b>SUPGRPS</b> -- Supplementary Group Names. The names of any supplementary group(s) established at login or inherited from a task's parent. They are displayed in a comma delimited list.<br><br> Note: The 'SUPGRPS' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width. When displayed, it and any other variable width columns are allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 characters).</li>
<li><b>SUSER</b> -- Saved Username. The saved username.</li>
<li><b>SWAP</b> -- Swapped Size (KiB). The non-resident portion of a task's address space.</li>
<li><b>TGID</b> -- Thread Group Id. The ID of the thread group that a task belongs. It is the PID of the thread group leader. In kernel terms, it represents those tasks that share an 'mm_struct'.</li>
<li><b>TIME</b> -- CPU Time. Total CPU time the task has used since it started. When 'Cumulative mode' is On, each process is listed with the cpu time that it and its dead children have used. You toggle 'Cumulative mode' with '<b>S</b>', which is both a command-line option and an interactive command. See the '<b>S</b>' interactive command for additional information regarding this mode.</li>
<li><b>TIME+</b> -- CPU Time (hundredths). The same as 'TIME', but reflecting more granularity through hundredths of a second.</li>
<li><b>TPGID</b> -- Tty Process Group Id. The process group ID of the foreground process for the connected <a href="/jargon/t/tty.htm">tty</a>, or -1 if a process is not connected to a terminal. By convention, this value equals the process ID (see PID) of the process group leader (see PGRP).</li>
<li><b>TTY</b> -- Controlling Tty. The name of the controlling terminal. The TTY is usually the device (serial port, pty, etc.) from which the process was started, and which it uses for input or output. However, a task need not be associated with a terminal, in which case you'll see '<b>?</b>' displayed.</li>
<li><b>UID</b> -- User Id. The effective user ID of the task's owner.</li>
<li><b>USER</b> -- Username. The effective username of the task's owner.</li>
<li><b>VIRT</b> -- Virtual Memory Size (KiB). The total amount of virtual memory used by the task. It includes all code, data and shared libraries plus pages that were swapped out and pages that were mapped but not used.</li>
<li><b>WCHAN</b> -- Sleeping in Function. Depending on the availability of the kernel link map ('System.map'), this field shows the name or the address of the kernel function in which the task is currently sleeping. Running tasks displays a dash ('<b>-</b>') in this column.<br><br> By displaying this field, top's own working set could be increased by over 700 Kb, depending on the kernel version. Should that occur, your only means of reducing that overhead is to stop and restart top.<br><br> Note: The 'WCHAN' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width. When displayed, it and any other variable width columns are allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 characters).</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="tab">Managing fields</h3>
<p class="tab">After pressing the interactive command '<b>f</b>' or '<b>F</b>' (Fields Management), you are presented with a screen showing: 1) the current window name; 2) the designated sort field; 3) all fields in their current order with descriptions. Entries marked with an asterisk are the currently displayed fields, screen width permitting.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the on-screen instructions indicate, you navigate among the fields with the Up and Down arrow keys. The PgUp, PgDn, Home and End keys can also be used to quickly reach the first or last available field.</li>
<li>The Right arrow key selects a field for repositioning and the Left arrow key or the &lt;Enter&gt; key commits that field's placement.</li>
<li>The '<b>d</b>' key or the &lt;Space&gt; bar toggles a field's display status, and thus the presence or absence of the asterisk.</li>
<li>The '<b>s</b>' key designates a field as the sort field. See topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SORTING for additional information regarding your selection of a sort field.</li>
<li>The '<b>a</b>' and '<b>w</b>' keys can cycle through all available windows and the '<b>q</b>' or &lt;Esc&gt; keys exit Fields Management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tab">The Fields Management screen can also be used to change the current window/field group in either full-screen mode or alternate-display mode. Whatever was targeted when '<b>q</b>' or &lt;Esc&gt; was pressed is made current as you return to the top display. See topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and the '<b>g</b>' interactive command for insight into current windows and field groups.</p>
<div class="tip tab" role="note">
<span class="title note">Note</span>
<p>Any window that was scrolled horizontally is reset if any field changes are made via the Fields Management screen. Any vertical scrolled position, however, is not affected. See topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information regarding vertical and horizontal scrolling.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="interactive-commands">Interactive commands</h2>
<p class="tab">Listed below is a brief index of commands within categories. Some commands appear more than once -- their meaning or scope may vary depending on the context in which they are issued.</p>
<h3 class="tab">Global commands</h3>
<p class="tab">The global interactive commands are always available in both full-screen mode and alternate-display mode. However, some of these interactive commands are not available when running in 'Secure mode'.</p>
<p class="tab">If you want to know in advance whether or not your top was secured, ask for help and view the system summary on the second line.</p>
<table class="mtable4 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td style="width:150px"><b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;Space&gt;</b></td>
<td><b>Refresh-Display</b><br><br> These commands awaken top, and following receipt of any input, the entire display is repainted. They also force an update of any hotplugged cpu or physical memory changes.<br><br> Use either of these keys if you have a large delay interval and want to see current status.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>?</b> or <b>h</b></td>
<td><b>Help</b><br><br> There are two help levels available. The first provides a reminder of all the basic interactive commands. If top is secured, that screen is abbreviated.<br><br> Typing '<b>h</b>' or '<b>?</b>' on that help screen takes you to help for those interactive commands applicable to alternate-display mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>=</b></td>
<td><b>Exit-Task-Limits</b><br><br> Removes restrictions on which tasks are shown. This command reverses any '<b>i</b>' (idle tasks) and '<b>n</b>' (max tasks) commands that might be active. It also provides for an 'exit' from pid monitoring and user filtering. See the '<b>-p</b>' command-line option for a discussion of PID monitoring and the '<b>U</b>' or '<b>u</b>' interactive commands regarding user filtering.<br><br> Additionally, any window that was scrolled is reset with this command.</td>

<td><b>Alternate-Display-Mode toggle</b><br><br> This command switches between full-screen mode and alternate-display mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>B</b></td>
<td><b>Bold-Disable/Enable toggle</b><br><br> This command influences use of the 'bold' terminfo capability and alters both the summary area and task area for the current window. While it is intended primarily for use with dumb terminals, it can be applied anytime.<br><br> Note: When this toggle is On and top is operating in monochrome mode, the entire display appears as normal text. Thus, unless the '<b>x</b>' or '<b>y</b>' toggles are using reverse for emphasis, when they are on, there is no visual confirmation.<br><br></td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>d</b> or <b>s</b></td>
<td>* <b>Change-Delay-Time-interval</b><br><br> You are prompted to enter the delay time, in seconds, between display updates.<br><br> Fractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is not allowed. Entering 0 causes (nearly) continuous updates, with an unsatisfactory display as the system and tty driver try to keep up with top's demands. The delay value is inversely proportional to system loading, so set it with care.<br><br> If at any time you want to know the current delay time, ask for help and view the system summary on the second line.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>g</b></td>
<td><b>Choose-Another-Window/Field-Group</b><br><br> You are prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4 designating the field group which should be made the current window. You soon grow comfortable with these 4 windows, especially after experimenting with alternate-display mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>H</b></td>
<td><b>Threads-mode toggle</b><br><br> When this toggle is On, individual threads are displayed for all processes in all visible task windows. Otherwise, top displays a summation of all threads in each process.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>I</b></td>
<td><b>IRIX/Solaris-Mode toggle</b><br><br> When operating in 'Solaris mode' ('<b>I</b>' toggled Off), a task's cpu usage is divided by the total number of CPUs. After issuing this command, you are told the new state of this toggle.</td>

<h2 id="tips-tricks">Tips and tricks</h2>
<p class="tab">Many of these 'tricks' work best when you give top a scheduling boost. So plan on starting it with a nice value of -10, assuming you've got the authority.</p>
<h3 class="tab">Kernel magic</h3>
<p class="tab">For these tricks, <b>top</b> needs full-screen mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user interface, through prompts and help, intentionally implies that the delay interval is limited to tenths of a second. However, you are free to set any desired delay. If you want to see Linux at his scheduling best, try a delay of .09 seconds or less.<br><br> For this experiment, under <a href="/jargon/x/xwin.htm">X Windows</a> open an xterm and maximize it. Then do the following:<br><br> 1. Provide a scheduling boost and tiny delay via:<b>nice -n -10 top -d.09</b>.<br> 2. Keep sorted column highlighting Off so as to minimize path length.<br> 3. Turn On reverse row highlighting for emphasis.<br> 4. Try various sort columns (TIME/MEM work well), and normal or reverse sorts to bring the most active processes into view.<br><br> What you see is a very busy Linux doing what it's always done for you, but there was no program available to illustrate this.<br><br></li>
<li>Under an xterm using 'white-on-black' colors, on top's Color Mapping screen set the task color to black and be sure that task highlighting is set to bold, not reverse. Then set the delay interval to around .3 seconds.<br><br> After bringing the most active processes into view, what you see are the ghostly images of only the currently running tasks.<br><br></li>
<li>Delete the existing rcfile, or create a new symlink. Start this new version then type '<b>T</b>' (a secret key, see topic 4c. Task Area Commands, SORTING) followed by '<b>W</b>' and '<b>q</b>'. Finally, restart the program with -d0 (zero delay).<br><br> Your display is refreshed at three times the rate of the former top, a 300% speed advantage. As top climbs the TIME ladder, be as patient as you can while speculating on whether or not top ever reaches the top.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="tab">Bouncing windows</h3>
<p class="tab">For these tricks, top needs alternate-display mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>With 3 or 4 task displays visible, pick any window other than the last and turn idle processes Off using the '<b>i</b>' command toggle. Depending on where you applied '<b>i</b>', sometimes several task displays are bouncing and sometimes it's like an accordion, as top tries his best to allocate space.</li>
<li>Set each window's summary lines differently: one with no memory ('<b>m</b>'); another with no states ('<b>t</b>'); maybe one with nothing at all, only the message line. Then hold down '<b>a</b>' or '<b>w</b>' and watch a variation on bouncing windows -- hopping windows.</li>
<li>Display all 4 windows and for each, in turn, set idle processes to Off using the '<b>i</b>' command toggle. You have entered the &quot;extreme bounce&quot; zone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="tab">The big bird window</h3>
<p class="tab">This trick also requires alternate-display mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>Display all 4 windows and make sure that 1:Def is the current window. Then, keep increasing window size with the '<b>n</b>' interactive command until all the other task displays are &quot;pushed out of the nest.&quot; When they all are displaced, toggle between all visible/invisible windows using the '<b>_</b>' command toggle. It's a truly mind-bending experience.</li>
