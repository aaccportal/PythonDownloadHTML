<h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
<p class="tab"><b>ld</b> accepts Linker Command Language files written in a superset of <a href="/comp/att.htm">AT&amp;T</a>'s Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.</p>
<p class="tab">For full details on the <b>ld</b> command language, see the <b>ld</b> <a href="/unix/info.htm">info</a> page. Here, we'll cover a broad overview of how to use <a href="/jargon/g/gnu.htm">GNU</a> ld, which is used in most versions of <a href="/jargon/l/linux.htm">Linux</a>.</p>
<p class="tab">This version of <b>ld</b> uses the general purpose BFD libraries to operate on object files. This allows <b>ld</b> to read, combine, and write object files in many different formats: for example, <b>COFF</b> or "<b>a.out</b>". Different formats may be linked together to produce any available kind of object file.</p>
<p class="tab">Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than other linkers in providing diagnostic information. Many linkers abandon execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible, <b>ld</b> continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors (or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).</p>
<p class="tab">The GNU linker <b>ld</b> covers a broad range of situations, and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers. As a result, you have many choices to control its behavior.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<pre class="tcy tab">ld [<i>options</i>] <i>objfile</i> ...</pre>
<h3 class="tab">Options</h3>
<p class="tab">The linker supports many <a href="/jargon/c/commandi.htm">command-line</a> options, but in actual practice few of them are used in any particular context. For instance, a frequent use of <b>ld</b> is to link standard Unix object files on a standard, supported Unix system. On such a system, to link a file "<b>hello.o</b>":</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">ld -o &lt;output&gt; /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc</pre>
<p class="tab">This tells <b>ld</b> to produce a file called <b>output</b> as the result of linking the file "<b>/lib/crt0.o</b>" with "<b>hello.o</b>" and the library "<b>libc.a</b>", which comes from the standard search directories. See the <b>-l</b> option below.</p>
<p class="tab">Some of the command-line options to <b>ld</b> may be specified at any point in the command line. However, options which refer to files, such as <b>-l</b> or <b>-T</b>, cause the file to be read at the point at which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object files and other file options. Repeating non-file options with a different argument either have no further effect, or override prior occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that option. Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are noted in the descriptions below.</p>
<p class="tab">Non-option arguments are object files or archives that are to be linked together. They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between an option and its argument.</p>
<p class="tab">Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can specify other forms of binary input files using <b>-l</b>, <b>-R</b>, and the script command language. If no binary input files at all are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the message &quot;<b>No input files</b>&quot;.</p>
<p class="tab">If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it assumes that it is a linker script. A script specified in this way augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default linker script or the one specified using <b>-T</b>). This feature permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object or an <a href="/jargon/a/archive.htm">archive</a>, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses &quot;INPUT&quot; or &quot;GROUP&quot; to load other objects. Specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script, with the extra commands placed after the main script; use the <b>-T</b> option to replace the default linker script entirely, but note the effect of the "INSERT" command.</p>
<p class="tab">For options whose names are a single letter, option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening <a href="/jargon/w/whitspac.htm">whitespace</a>, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them.</p>
<p class="tab">For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can precede the option name; for example, <b>-trace-symbol</b> and <b>--trace-symbol</b> are equivalent. Note that there is one exception to this rule: Multiple letter options that start with a lowercase '<b>o</b>' can only be preceded by two dashes. This is to reduce confusion with the <b>-o</b> option. So for example <b>-omagic</b> sets the output file name to <b>magic</b> whereas <b>--omagic</b> sets the <b>NMAGIC</b> flag on the output.</p>
<p class="tab">Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them. For example, <b>--trace-symbol foo</b> and <b>--trace-symbol=foo</b> are equivalent. Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are accepted.</p>
<p class="tab">Note that if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver (e.g., <a href="/jargon/g/gcc.htm">gcc</a>) then all the linker command line options should be prefixed by <b>-Wl</b>, (or whatever is appropriate for the particular compiler driver) like this:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">gcc -Wl,--start-group foo.o bar.o -Wl,--end-group</pre>
<p class="tab">This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link. Confusion may also arise when passing options that require values through a driver, as the use of a space between option and argument acts as a separator, and causes the driver to pass only the option to the linker and the argument to the compiler. In this case, it is simplest to use the joined forms of both single- and multiple-letter options, such as:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">gcc foo.o bar.o -Wl,-eENTRY -Wl,-Map=a.map</pre>
<p class="tab">Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the GNU linker:</p>
<table class="mtable4 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td style="width:340px"><b>@</b><i>file</i></td>
<td>Read command-line options from <i>file</i>. The options read are inserted in place of the original <b>@</b><i>file</i> option. If <i>file</i> does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option is treated literally, and not removed.<br><br> Options in <i>file</i> are separated by <a href="/jargon/w/whitspac.htm">whitespace</a>. A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash. The file may itself contain additional <b>@</b><i>file</i> options; any such options are processed <a href="/jargon/r/recursive.htm">recursively</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-a</b> <i>keyword</i></td>
<td>This option is supported for <a href="/jargon/h/hp-ux.htm">HP-UX</a> compatibility. The <i>keyword</i> argument must be one of the <a href="/jargon/s/string.htm">strings</a> <b>archive</b>, <b>shared</b>, or <b>default</b>. <b>-aarchive</b> is functionally equivalent to <b>-Bstatic</b>, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent to <b>-Bdynamic</b>. This option may be used any number of times.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--audit</b> AUDITLIB</td>
<td>Adds AUDITLIB to the "DT_AUDIT" entry of the dynamic section. AUDITLIB is not checked for existence, nor will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library. If specified multiple times "DT_AUDIT" contains a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use. If the linker finds an object with an audit entry while searching for shared libraries, it adds a corresponding "DT_DEPAUDIT" entry in the output file. This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the "rtld-audit" interface.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-A</b> <i>architecture</i><br><br><b>--architecture=</b><i>architecture</i></td>
<td>In the current release of <b>ld</b>, this option is useful only for the <a href="/comp/intel.htm">Intel</a> 960 family of <a href="/jargon/a/architec.htm">architectures</a>. In that <b>ld</b> configuration, the architecture argument identifies the particular architecture in the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the archive-library search path.<br><br> Future releases of <b>ld</b> may support similar functionality for other architecture families.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-b</b> <i>input-format</i><br><br><b>--format=</b><i>input-format</i></td>
<td><b>ld</b> may be configured to support more than one kind of object file. If your <b>ld</b> is configured this way, you can use the <b>-b</b> option to specify the binary format for input object files that follow this option on the command line. Even when <b>ld</b> is configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as <b>ld</b> should be configured to expect as a default input format the most usual format on each machine. The <i>input-format</i> is a text string, the name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries. You can list the available binary formats with <b>objdump -i</b>.<br><br> You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual binary format. You can also use <b>-b</b> to switch formats explicitly (when linking object files of different formats), by including <b>-b</b> <i>input-format</i> before each group of object files in a particular format.<br><br> The default format is taken from the <a href="/jargon/e/envivari.htm">environment variable</a> "GNUTARGET".<br><br> You can also define the input format from a script, using the command "TARGET";</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-c</b> <i>MRI-commandfile</i><br><br><b>--mri-script=</b><i>MRI-commandfile</i></td>
<td>For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, <b>ld</b> accepts script files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in the MRI Compatible Script Files section of GNU <b>ld</b> documentation. Introduce MRI script files with the option <b>-c</b>; use the <b>-T</b> option to run linker scripts written in the general-purpose <b>ld</b> scripting language. If <i>MRI-cmdfile</i> does not exist, <b>ld</b> looks for it in the directories specified by any <b>-L</b> options.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-d</b><br><br><b>-dc</b><br><br><b>-dp</b></td>
<td>These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for compatibility with other linkers. They assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file is specified (with <b>-r</b>). The script command "FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--depaudit</b> AUDITLIB<br><br><b>-P</b> AUDITLIB</td>
<td>Adds AUDITLIB to the "DT_DEPAUDIT" entry of the dynamic section. AUDITLIB is not checked for existence, nor will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library. If specified multiple times "DT_DEPAUDIT" contains a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use. This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the "rtld-audit" interface. The <b>-P</b> option is provided for Solaris compatibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-e</b> <i>entry</i><br><br><b>--entry=</b><i>entry</i></td>
<td>Use <i>entry</i> as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your program, rather than the default entry point. If there is no symbol named <i>entry</i>, the linker tries to parse <i>entry</i> as a number, and use that as the <i>entry</i> address (the number is interpreted in <a href="/jargon/d/decimal.htm">base 10</a>; you may use a leading 0x for base 16, or a leading 0 for base 8).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--exclude-libs</b> <i>lib,lib,</i>...</td>
<td>Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically exported. The library names may be <a href="/jargon/d/delimite.htm">delimited</a> by commas or colons. Specifying "<b>--exclude-libs ALL</b>" excludes symbols in all archive libraries from automatic export. This option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port of the linker and for ELF targeted ports. For i386 PE, symbols explicitly listed in a <b>.def</b> file are still exported, regardless of this option. For ELF targeted ports, symbols affected by this option is treated as hidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>--exclude-modules-for-implib</b> <i>module,module,</i>...</td>
<td>Specifies a list of object files or archive members, from which symbols should not be automatically exported, but which should be copied wholesale into the import library being generated during the link. The module names may be delimited by commas or colons, and must match exactly the file names used by <b>ld</b> to open the files; for archive members, this is the member name, but for object files the name listed must include and match precisely any path used to specify the input file on the linker's command-line. This option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port of the linker. Symbols explicitly listed in a <b>.def</b> file are still exported, regardless of this option.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-E<br><br> --export-dynamic<br><br> --no-export-dynamic</b></td>
<td>When creating a dynamically linked executable, using the <b>-E</b> option or the <b>--export-dynamic</b> option causes the linker to add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table. The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols that are visible from dynamic objects at run time.<br><br> If you do not use either of these options (or use the <b>--no-export-dynamic</b> option to restore the default behavior), the dynamic symbol table normally contains only those symbols that are referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link.<br><br> If you use "<b>dlopen</b>" to load a dynamic object which needs to refer back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other dynamic object, then you probably need to use this option when linking the program itself.<br><br> You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols should be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it. See the description of <b>--dynamic-list</b>.<br><br> Note that this option is specific to ELF targeted ports. PE targets support a similar function to export all symbols from a <a href="/jargon/d/dll.htm">DLL</a> or <a href="/jargon/e/execfile.htm">EXE</a>; see the description of <b>--export-all-symbols</b> below.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-EB</b></td>
<td>Link big-<a href="/jargon/e/endian.htm">endian</a> objects. This affects the default output format.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-EL</b></td>
<td>Link little-endian objects. This affects the default output format.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-f</b> <i>name</i><br><br><b>--auxiliary=</b><i>name</i></td>
<td>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field to the specified name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the symbol table of the shared object name.<br><br> If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker sees the DT_AUXILIARY field. If the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it first checks whether there is a definition in the shared object name. If there is one, it is used instead of the definition in the filter object. The shared object name need not exist. Thus the shared object name may be used to provide an alternative implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for machine specific performance.<br><br> This option may be specified more than once. The DT_AUXILIARY entries is created in the order where they appear on the command line.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-F</b> <i>name</i><br><br><b>--filter=</b><i>name</i></td>
<td>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to the specified name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object that is being created should be used as a filter on the symbol table of the shared object name.<br><br> If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker sees the DT_FILTER field. The dynamic linker resolves symbols according to the symbol table of the filter object as usual, but it actually links to the definitions found in the shared object name. Thus the filter object can select a subset of the symbols provided by the object name.<br><br> Some older linkers used the <b>-F</b> option throughout a compilation toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output object files. The GNU linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the <b>-b</b>, <b>--format</b>, <b>--oformat</b> options, the "TARGET" command in linker scripts, and the "GNUTARGET" environment variable. The GNU linker ignores the <b>-F</b> option when not creating an ELF shared object.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-fini=</b><i>name</i></td>
<td>When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting DT_FINI to the address of the function. By default, the linker uses "<b>_fini</b>" as the function to call.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-g</b></td>
<td>Ignored. Provided for compatibility with other tools.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-G</b> <i>value</i><br><br><b>--gpsize=</b><i>value</i></td>
<td>Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register to size. This is only meaningful for object file formats such as MIPS ECOFF which supports putting large and small objects into different sections. This is ignored for other object file formats.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-h</b> <i>name</i><br><br><b>-soname=</b><i>name</i></td>
<td>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to the specified name. When an executable is linked with a shared object which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic linker attempts to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-i</b></td>
<td>Perform an incremental link (same as option <b>-r</b>).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-init=</b><i>name</i></td>
<td>When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the executable or shared object is loaded, by setting DT_INIT to the address of the function. By default, the linker uses "_init" as the function to call.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-l</b> <i>namespec</i><br><br><b>--library=</b><i>namespec</i></td>
<td>Add the archive or object file specified by <i>namespec</i> to the list of files to link. This option may be used any number of times. If <i>namespec</i> is of the form <b>:</b><i>filename</i>, <b>ld</b> searches the library path for a file called <i>filename</i>, otherwise it searches the library path for a file called <b>lib</b><i>namespec</i><b>.a</b>.<br><br> On systems which support shared libraries, <b>ld</b> may also search for files other than <b>lib</b><i>namespec</i><b>.a</b>. Specifically, on ELF and <a href="/comp/sun.htm">SunOS</a> systems, <b>ld</b> searches a directory for a library called <b>lib</b><i>namespec</i><b>.so</b> before searching for one called <b>lib</b><i>namespec</i><b>.a</b>. By convention, a "<b>.so</b>" extension indicates a shared library. Note that this behavior does not apply to <b>:</b><i>filename</i>, which always specifies a file called <i>filename</i>.<br><br> The linker searches an archive only once, at the location where it is specified on the command line. If the archive defines a symbol which was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the command line, the linker includes the appropriate file(s) from the archive. However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on the command line won't cause the linker to search the archive again.<br><br> See the <b>-(</b> option for a way to force the linker to search archives multiple times.<br><br> You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.<br><br> This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers. However, if you are using <b>ld</b> on <a href="/jargon/a/aix.htm">AIX</a>, note that it is different from the behaviour of the AIX linker.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-L</b> <i>searchdir</i><br><br> <b>--library-path=</b><i>searchdir</i>is m</td>
<td>Add path <i>searchdir</i> to the list of paths that <b>ld</b> searches for archive libraries and <b>ld</b> control scripts. You may use this option any number of times. The directories are searched in the order where they are specified on the command line. Directories specified on the command line are searched before the default directories. All <b>-L</b> options apply to all <b>-l</b> options, regardless of the order where the options appear. <b>-L</b> options do not affect how <b>ld</b> searches for a linker script unless <b>-T</b> option is specified.<br><br> If <i>searchdir</i> begins with "<b>=</b>", then the "<b>=</b>" is replaced by the <b>sysroot</b> prefix, a path specified when the linker is configured.<br><br> The default set of paths searched (without being specified with <b>-L</b>) depends on which emulation mode <b>ld</b> uses, and in some cases also on how it was configured at build time.<br><br> The paths can also be specified in a link script with the "SEARCH_DIR" command. Directories specified this way are searched at the point where the linker script appears in the command line.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-m</b> <i>emulation</i></td>
<td>Emulate the emulation linker. You can list the available emulations with the <b>--verbose</b> or <b>-V</b> options.<br><br> If the <b>-m</b> option is not used, the emulation is taken from the "LDEMULATION" environment variable, if that is defined.<br><br> Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was configured.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><b>-M</b><br><br><b>--print-map</b></td>
<td>Print a link map to the standard output. A link map provides information about the link, including the following:<br><ul><li>Where object files are mapped into memory.</li><li>How common symbols are allocated.</li><li>All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol that caused the archive member.</li><li>The values assigned to symbols.</li></ul> Note: symbols whose values are computed by an <a href="/jargon/e/expressi.htm">expression</a> which involves a reference to a previous value of the same symbol may not have correct result displayed in the link map. This is because the linker discards intermediate results and only retains the final value of an expression. Under such circumstances the linker displays the final value enclosed by square brackets. Thus for example a linker script containing:<br><br><pre class="tcy">foo = 1 foo = foo * 4 foo = foo + 8</pre> produces the following output in the link map if the <b>-M</b> option is used:<br><br><pre class="tcy">0x00000001 foo = 0x1 [0x0000000c] foo = (foo * 0x4) [0x0000000c] foo = (foo + 0x8)</pre></td>

Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.<br><br> There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:<br><br><pre class="tcy">int i = 1;</pre> A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output file.<br><br><pre>extern int i;</pre> An undefined reference, which does not allocate space. There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the variable somewhere.<br><br><pre class="tcy">int i;</pre> A common symbol.

The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is a definition of the same variable.<br><br> The <b>--warn-common</b> option can produce five kinds of warnings.

Executable images generated with these long section names are slightly non-standard, carrying as they do a string table, and may generate confusing output when examined with non-GNU PE-aware tools, such as file viewers and dumpers. However, GDB relies on the use of PE long section names to find Dwarf-2 debug information sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if neither option is specified on the command-line, <b>ld</b> enables long section names, overriding the default and technically correct behaviour, when it finds the presence of debug information while linking an executable image and not stripping symbols.

<td><b>--enable-auto-import</b></td>
<td>Do sophisticated linking of "<b>_symbol</b>" to "<b>__imp__symbol</b>" for DATA imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when building the import libraries with those DATA exports. Note: Use of the '<b>auto-import</b>' extension causes the text section of the image file to be made writable. This does not conform to the PE-COFF format specification published by Microsoft.<br><br> Note: use of the 'auto-import' extension also causes read only data which would normally be placed into the <b>.rdata</b> section to be placed into the <b>.data</b> section instead. This is to work around a problem with consts that is described <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html" class="external">at the cygwin website</a>.<br><br> Using 'auto-import' generally 'just works', but sometimes you may see this message:<br><br><pre class="tcy">"variable '&lt;var&gt;' can't be auto-imported. Please read the documentation for ld's "--enable-auto-import" for details."</pre> This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only allow one). Instances where this may occur include accesses to member fields of <b>struct</b> variables imported from a DLL, as well as using a constant index into an array variable imported from a DLL. Any multiword variable (<b>array</b>s, <b>struct</b>s, <b>long long</b>, etc) may trigger this error condition. However, regardless of the exact data type of the offending exported variable, <b>ld</b> always detects it, issue the warning, and exit.<br><br> There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the data type of the exported variable:<br><br> One way is to use <b>--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc</b> switch. This leaves the task of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so this method works only when runtime environment supports this feature.<br><br> A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable -- that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time. For arrays, there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable. Thus:<br><br><pre class="tcy">extern type extern_array[]; extern_array[1] --&gt; { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }</pre> or<br><br><pre class="tcy">extern type extern_array[]; extern_array[1] --&gt; { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }</pre> For <b>struct</b>s (and most other multiword data types) the only option is to make the <b>struct</b> itself (or the <b>long long</b>, etc.) variable:<br><br><pre class="tcy">extern struct s extern_struct; extern_struct.field --&gt; { volatile struct s *t=&amp;extern_struct; t-&gt;field }</pre> or<br><br><pre class="tcy">extern long long extern_ll; extern_ll --&gt; { volatile long long * local_ll=&amp;extern_ll; *local_ll }</pre> A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon 'auto-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with "<b>__declspec(dllimport)</b>". However, in practice that requires using compile-time <b>#defines</b> to indicate whether you are building a DLL, building client code that links to the DLL, or merely building/linking to a static library. In making the choice between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:<br><br> Original:<br><br><b>foo.h</b>:<br><br><pre class="tcy">extern int arr[];</pre><b>foo.c</b>:<br><br><pre class="tcy">#include "foo.h"void main(int argc, char **argv){ printf("%d\n",arr[1]);}</pre> Solution 1:<br><br><b>foo.h</b>:<br><br><pre class="tcy">extern int arr[];</pre><b>foo.c</b>:<br><br><pre class="tcy">#include "foo.h"void main(int argc, char **argv){ printf("%d\n",arr[1]);}</pre> Solution 2:<br><br><b>foo.h</b>:<br><br><pre class="tcy">extern int arr[];</pre><b>foo.c</b>:<br><br><pre class="tcy">#include "foo.h"void main(int argc, char **argv){ /* This workaround is for win32  and cygwin; do not "optimize" */ volatile int *parr = arr; printf("%d\n",parr[1]);}</pre> A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface for the offending variables (e.g., <b>set_foo()</b> and <b>get_foo()</b> accessory functions).

<h3 class="tab">Environment</h3>
<p class="tab">You can change the behaviour of <b>ld</b> with the <a href="/jargon/e/envivari.htm">environment variables</a> "<b>GNUTARGET</b>", "<b>LDEMULATION</b>" and "<b>COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE</b>".</p>
<p class="tab">"<b>GNUTARGET</b>" determines the input-file object format if you don't use <b>-b</b> (or its synonym <b>--format</b>). Its value should be one of the BFD names for an input format. If there is no "<b>GNUTARGET</b>" in the environment, <b>ld</b> uses the natural format of the target. If "<b>GNUTARGET</b>" is set to "default" then BFD attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files; this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities since there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify object-file formats is unique. However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each system places the conventional format for that system first in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.</p>
<p class="tab">"<b>LDEMULATION</b>" determines the default emulation if you don't use the <b>-m</b> option. The emulation can affect various aspects of linker behaviour, particularly the default linker script. You can list the available emulations with the <b>--verbose</b> or <b>-V</b> options. If the <b>-m</b> option is not used, and the "<b>LDEMULATION</b>" environment variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was configured.</p>
<p class="tab">Normally, the linker defaults to demangling symbols. However, if "<b>COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE</b>" is set in the environment, then it defaults to not demangling symbols. This environment variable is used in a similar fashion by the <a href="/jargon/g/gcc.htm">gcc</a> linker wrapper program. The default may be overridden by the <b>--demangle</b> and <b>--no-demangle</b> options.</p>
