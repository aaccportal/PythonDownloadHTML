<h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
<p class="tab">The <b>sar</b> command writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the <a href="/jargon/o/os.htm">operating system</a>. The accounting system, based on the values in the <i>count</i> and <i>interval</i> <a href="/jargon/p/paramete.htm">parameters</a>, writes information the specified number of times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is set to zero, the <b>sar</b> command displays the average statistics for the time since the system was started. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is specified without the <i>count</i> parameter, then reports are generated continuously. The collected data can also be saved in the file specified by the <b>-o</b> <i>file name</i> flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If <i>file name</i> is omitted, <b>sar</b> uses the standard system activity daily data file, the <b>/var/log/sysstat/sa</b><i>dd</i> file, where the <i>dd</i> parameter indicates the current day. By default, all the data available from the <a href="/jargon/k/kernel.htm">kernel</a> are saved in the data file.</p>
<p class="tab">The <b>sar</b> command extracts and writes to standard output records previously saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the <b>-f</b> flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file. It is also possible to enter <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b> (etc.) as an <a href="/jargon/a/argument.htm">argument</a> to <b>sar</b> to display data of that days ago. For example, <b>-1</b> points at the standard system activity file of yesterday.</p>
<p class="tab">Without the <b>-P</b> flag, the <b>sar</b> command reports system-wide (global among all <a href="/jargon/c/cpu.htm">processors</a>) statistics, which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. If the <b>-P</b> flag is given, the <b>sar</b> command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or processors. If <b>-P ALL</b> is given, the <b>sar</b> command reports statistics for each processor and global statistics among all processors.</p>
<p class="tab">You can select information about specific system activities using flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity. Specifying the <b>-A</b> flag selects all possible activities.</p>
<p class="tab">The default version of the <b>sar</b> command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent (user + <a href="/unix/unice.htm">nice</a> + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.</p>
<p class="tab">If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient to specify an output file for the <b>sar</b> command. Run the <b>sar</b> command as a background process. The syntax for this is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">sar -o datafile interval count &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</pre>
<p class="tab">All data are captured in <a href="/jargon/b/binary.htm">binary</a> form and saved to a file (datafile). The data can then be selectively displayed with the <b>sar</b> command using the <b>-f</b> option. Set the <i>interval</i> and <i>count</i> parameters to select <i>count</i> records at <i>interval</i> second intervals. If the <i>count</i> parameter is not set, all the records saved in the file is selected. Collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a period and determine peak usage hours.</p>
<p class="tab">Note: The <b>sar</b> command only reports on local activities.</p>
