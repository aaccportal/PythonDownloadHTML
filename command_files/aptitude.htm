The packages should be listed after the "<b>install</b>" command; if a package name contains a tilde character ("<b>~</b>") or a question mark ("<b>?</b>"), it will be treated as a search pattern and every package matching the pattern will be installed.<br><br> To select a particular <a href="/jargon/v/version.htm">version</a> of the package, append <b>=&lt;version&gt;</b> to the package name: for instance, <b>aptitude install apt=0.3.1</b>. Similarly, to select a package from a particular <a href="/jargon/a/archive.htm">archive</a>, append <b>/&lt;archive&gt;</b> to the package name: for instance, <b>aptitude install apt/experimental</b>. You cannot specify both an archive and a version for a package.<br><br> Not every package listed on the command line has to be installed; you can tell aptitude to do something different with a package by appending an "override specifier" to the name of the package. For example, <b>aptitude remove wesnoth+</b> will install "wesnoth", not remove it. The following override specifiers are available:<br><br>

As a special case, "<b>install</b>" with no arguments will act on any stored/pending actions.<br><br>
Once you enter "Y" at the final confirmation prompt, the <b>install</b> command modifies aptitude's stored information about what actions to perform. Therefore, if you issue (for example) the command <b>aptitude install foo bar</b> and then abort the installation once aptitude has started downloading and installing packages, you need to run <b>aptitude remove foo bar</b> to cancel that order.

For more information on search patterns, see the section "Search Patterns" in the aptitude reference manual.<br><br> In the example above, <b>aptitude search '~N' edit</b> has two arguments after search and thus is searching for two patterns: "~N" and "edit". As described in the search pattern reference, a single pattern composed of two sub-patterns separated by a space (such as <b>~N edit</b>) matches only if both patterns match. Thus, the command <b>aptitude search '~N edit'</b> only shows "new" packages whose name contains "edit".<br><br> Each search result is listed on a separate line. The first character of each line indicates the current state of the package: the most common states are <b>p</b>, meaning that no trace of the package exists on the system, <b>c</b>, meaning that the package was deleted but its configuration files remain on the system, <b>i</b>, meaning that the package is installed, and <b>v</b>, meaning that the package is virtual. The second character indicates the stored action (if any; otherwise a blank space is displayed) to be performed on the package, with the most common actions being <b>i</b>, meaning that the package will be installed, <b>d</b>, meaning that the package will be deleted, and <b>p</b>, meaning that the package and its configuration files will be removed. If the third character is <b>A</b>, the package was automatically installed.<br><br> To customize the <a href="/jargon/o/output.htm">output</a> of search, see the command-line options <b>-F</b> and <b>--sort</b>.</td>

Otherwise, information about the "candidate version" (the version that <b>aptitude install</b> would download) is displayed.<br><br> You can display information about a different version of the package by appending <b>=&lt;version&gt;</b> to the package name; you can display the version from a particular archive or release by appending <b>/&lt;archive&gt;</b> or <b>/&lt;release&gt;</b> to the package name: for instance, <b>/unstable</b> or <b>/sid</b>.

The leftmost three characters indicate the current state, planned state (if any), and whether the package was automatically installed; for more information on their meanings, see the documentation of <b>aptitude search</b>. To the right of the version number you can find the releases from which the version is available, and the pin priority of the version.<br><br> If a package name contains a tilde character ("<b>~</b>") or a question mark ("<b>?</b>"), it will be treated as a search pattern and all matching versions are displayed (see the section "Search Patterns" in the aptitude reference manual).

</pre>
If the input is a search pattern, or if more than one package's versions are to be displayed, aptitude automatically groups the output by package, as shown above. You can disable this via <b>--group-by=none</b>, in which case aptitude displays a single list of all the versions that were found and automatically include the package name in each output line:<br><br>

In addition to the above options, the information printed for each version can be controlled by the command-line option <b>-F</b>.

For instance, if A requires B, C requires D, and B and C conflict, <b>aptitude why-not D</b> will not produce the answer "A depends on B, B conflicts with C, and D depends on C". By default, aptitude outputs only the "most installed, strongest, tightest, shortest" dependency chain. That is, it looks for a chain that only contains packages that are installed or will be installed; it looks for the strongest possible dependencies under that restriction; it looks for chains that avoid OR'ed dependencies and Provides; and it looks for the shortest dependency chain meeting those criteria.
