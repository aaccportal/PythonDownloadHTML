<h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
<p class="tab"><b>less</b> is a program similar to <a href="/unix/umore.htm">more</a>, but it has many more features. <b>less</b> does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like <a href="/unix/uvi.htm">vi</a>. <b>less</b> uses <b>termcap</b> (or <b>terminfo</b> on some systems), so it can run on a variety of <a href="/jargon/t/terminal.htm">terminals</a>. There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals. On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret ("<b>^</b>").</p>
<p class="tab">Commands are based on both <b>more</b> and <b>vi</b>. Commands may be preceded by a <a href="/jargon/d/decimal.htm">decimal</a> number, called <i>N</i> in the descriptions below. The number is used by some commands, as indicated.</p>

<p class="tab">or if you use <a href="/unix/ush.htm">sh</a>:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">LESS="-options"; export LESS</pre>
<p class="tab">On MS-DOS, you don't need the quotes, but you should replace any percent signs in the options string by double percent signs.</p>
<p class="tab">The environment variable is parsed before the command line, so command line options override the LESS environment variable. If an option appears in the LESS variable, it can be reset to its default value on the command line by beginning the command line option with "<b>-+</b>".</p>
<p class="tab">Some options like <b>-k</b> or <b>-D</b> require a string to follow the option letter. The string for that option is considered to end when a dollar sign (<b>$</b>) is found. For example, you can set two <b>-D</b> options on MS-DOS like this:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">LESS="Dn9.1$Ds4.1"</pre>
<p class="tab">A dollar sign or backslash may be included literally in an option string by preceding it with a backslash.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</h2>
<p class="tab">You may define <b>less</b> commands using the program <b>lesskey</b> to create a <b>lesskey</b> file. This file specifies a set of command keys and an action associated with each key. You may also use <b>lesskey</b> to change the line-editing keys (see <a href="#Line-Editing">LINE EDITING</a>), and to set <a href="/jargon/e/envivari.htm">environment variables</a>. If the environment variable <b>LESSKEY</b> is set, <b>less</b> uses that as the name of the lesskey file. Otherwise, <b>less</b> looks in a standard place for the lesskey file: On Unix systems, <b>less</b> looks for a lesskey file called &quot;<b>$HOME/.less</b>&quot;. On MS-DOS and Windows systems, <b>less</b> looks for a lesskey file called &quot;<b>$HOME/_less</b>&quot;, and if it is not found there, then looks for a lesskey file called &quot;<b>_less</b>&quot; in any directory specified in the PATH environment variable. On OS/2 systems, <b>less</b> looks for a lesskey file called &quot;<b>$HOME/less.ini</b>&quot;, and if it is not found, it looks for a lesskey file called &quot;less.ini&quot; in any directory specified in the INIT environment variable, and if it not found there, it looks for a lesskey file called &quot;less.ini&quot; in any directory specified in the PATH environment variable.</p>
<p class="tab">A system-wide lesskey file may also be set up to provide key bindings. If a key is defined in both a local lesskey file and in the system-wide file, key bindings in the local file take precedence over those in the system-wide file. If the environment variable <b>LESSKEY_SYSTEM</b> is set, <b>less</b> uses that as the name of the system-wide lesskey file. Otherwise, <b>less</b> looks in a standard place for the system-wide lesskey file: On Unix systems, the system-wide lesskey file is <b>/usr/local/etc/sysless</b>. (However, if <b>less</b> was built with a different sysconf directory than <b>/usr/local/etc</b>, that directory is where the sysless file is found.) On MS-DOS and Windows systems, the system-wide lesskey file is <b>c:\_sysless</b>. On OS/2 systems, the system-wide lesskey file is <b>c:\sysless.ini</b>.</p>
<h2 id="Input-Preprocessor">Input Preprocessor</h2>
<p class="tab">You may define an "input preprocessor" for <b>less</b>. Before <b>less</b> opens a file, it first gives your input preprocessor a chance to modify the way the contents of the file are displayed. An input preprocessor is an executable program (or shell script), which writes the contents of the file to a different file, called the replacement file. The contents of the replacement file are then displayed in place of the contents of the original file. However, it will appear to the user as if the original file is opened; that is, <b>less</b> displays the original filename as the name of the current file.</p>
<p class="tab">An input preprocessor receives one command line argument, the original filename, as entered by the user. It should create the replacement file, and when finished, print the name of the replacement file to its standard output. If the input preprocessor does not output a replacement filename, <b>less</b> uses the original file, as normal. The input preprocessor is not called when viewing <a href="/jargon/s/stdin.htm">standard input</a>. To set up an input preprocessor, set the <b>LESSOPEN</b> environment variable to a command line which will invoke your input preprocessor. This command line should include one occurrence of the string "<b>%s</b>", which will be replaced by the filename when the input preprocessor command is invoked.</p>
<p class="tab">When <b>less</b> closes a file opened in such a way, it will call another program, called the input postprocessor, which may perform any desired clean-up action (such as deleting the replacement file created by <b>LESSOPEN</b>). This program receives two command line arguments, the original filename as entered by the user, and the name of the replacement file. To set up an input postprocessor, set the <b>LESSCLOSE</b> environment variable to a command line which will invoke your input postprocessor. It may include two occurrences of the string "<b>%s</b>"; the first is replaced with the original name of the file and the second with the name of the replacement file, which was output by <b>LESSOPEN</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">For example, on many Unix systems, these two scripts will allow you to keep files in compressed format, but still let<b>less</b>view them directly:</p>
<p class="tab"><b>lessopen.sh</b>:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">#! /bin/sh
case "$1" in
*.Z) uncompress -
     if [ -s /tmp/less.$$ ]; then
          echo /tmp/less.$$
     else
          rm -f /tmp/less.$$
     fi
     ;;
esac</pre>
<p class="tab"><b>lessclose.sh</b>:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">#! /bin/sh rm $2</pre>
<p class="tab">To use these scripts, put them both where they can be executed and set <b>LESSOPEN="lessopen.sh %s"</b>, and <b>LESSCLOSE="lessclose.sh %s %s"</b>. More complex <b>LESSOPEN</b> and <b>LESSCLOSE</b> scripts may be written to accept other types of compressed files, and so on.</p>
<p class="tab">It is also possible to set up an input preprocessor to pipe the file data directly to less, rather than putting the data into a replacement file. This avoids the need to decompress the entire file before starting to view it. An input preprocessor that works this way is called an <i>input pipe</i>. An input pipe, instead of writing the name of a replacement file on its standard output, writes the entire contents of the replacement file on its standard output. If the input pipe does not write any characters on its standard output, then there is no replacement file and <b>less</b> uses the original file, as normal. To use an input pipe, make the first character in the <b>LESSOPEN</b> environment variable a vertical bar (<b>|</b>) to signify that the input preprocessor is an input pipe.</p>
<p class="tab">For example, on many Unix systems, this script will work like the previous example scripts:</p>
<p class="tab"><b>lesspipe.sh</b>:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">#! /bin/sh
case "$1" in
*.Z) uncompress -c $1  2&gt;/dev/null
*)   exit 1
     ;;
esac
exit $?</pre>
<p class="tab">To use this script, put it where it can be executed and set <b>LESSOPEN="|lesspipe.sh %s"</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">Note that a preprocessor cannot output an empty file, since that is interpreted as meaning there is no replacement, and the original file is used. To avoid this, if <b>LESSOPEN</b> starts with two vertical bars, the exit status of the script becomes meaningful. If the exit status is zero, the output is considered to be replacement text, even if it empty. If the exit status is nonzero, any output is ignored and the original file is used. For compatibility with previous versions of <b>less</b>, if <b>LESSOPEN</b> starts with only one vertical bar, the exit status of the preprocessor is ignored.</p>
<p class="tab">When an input pipe is used, a <b>LESSCLOSE</b> postprocessor can be used, but it is usually not necessary since there is no replacement file to clean up. In this case, the replacement file name passed to the <b>LESSCLOSE</b> postprocessor is "<b>-</b>".</p>
<p class="tab">For compatibility with previous versions of <b>less</b>, the input preprocessor or pipe is not used if <b>less</b> is viewing standard input. However, if the first character of <b>LESSOPEN</b> is a dash (<b>-</b>), the input preprocessor is used on standard input as well as other files. In this case, the dash is not considered to be part of the preprocessor command. If standard input is being viewed, the input preprocessor is passed a file name consisting of a single dash. Similarly, if the first two characters of <b>LESSOPEN</b> are vertical bar and dash (<b>|-</b>) or two vertical bars and a dash (<b>||-</b>), the input pipe is used on standard input as well as other files. Again, in this case the dash is not considered to be part of the input pipe command.</p>
<h2>National Character Sets</h2>
<p class="tab">There are three types of characters in the input file:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>normal characters</b> can be displayed directly to the screen.</li>
<li><b>control characters</b> should not be displayed directly, but are expected to be found in ordinary text files (such as backspace and tab).</li>
<li><b>binary characters</b> should not be displayed directly and are not expected to be found in text files.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tab">A "character set" is a description of which characters are to be considered normal, control, and binary. The <b>LESSCHARSET</b> environment variable may be used to select a character set. Possible values for <b>LESSCHARSET</b> are:</p>
<table class="mtable4 tab">

</table>
<p class="tab">In rare cases, it may be desired to tailor <b>less</b> to use a character set other than the ones definable by <b>LESSCHARSET</b>. In this case, the environment variable <b>LESSCHARDEF</b> can be used to define a character set. It should be set to a string where each character in the string represents one character in the character set. The character "<b>.</b>" is used for a normal character, "<b>c</b>" for control, and "<b>b</b>" for binary. A decimal number may be used for repetition. For example, "<b>bccc4b.</b>" would mean character 0 is binary, 1, 2 and 3 are control, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are binary, and 8 is normal. All characters after the last are taken to be the same as the last, so characters 9 through 255 would be normal. (This is an example, and does not necessarily represent any real character set.)</p>

<p class="tab">If that string is not found, but your system supports the <b>setlocale</b> interface, <b>less</b> will use <b>setlocale</b> to determine the character set. <b>setlocale</b> is controlled by setting the <b>LANG</b> or <b>LC_CTYPE</b> environment variables.</p>

<p class="tab">Control and binary characters are displayed in standout (reverse video). Each such character is displayed in caret notation if possible (e.g., <b>^A</b> for <b>control-A</b>). Caret notation is used only if inverting the <b>0100</b> bit results in a normal printable character. Otherwise, the character is displayed as a <a href="/jargon/h/hex.htm">hex</a> number in angle brackets. This format can be changed by setting the <b>LESSBINFMT</b> environment variable. <b>LESSBINFMT</b> may begin with a "<b>*</b>" and one character to select the display attribute: "<b>*k</b>" is blinking, "<b>*d</b>" is bold, "<b>*u</b>" is underlined, "<b>*s</b>" is standout, and "<b>*n</b>" is normal. If <b>LESSBINFMT</b> does not begin with a "<b>*</b>", normal attribute is assumed. The remainder of <b>LESSBINFMT</b> is a string which may include one <a href="/unix/uprintf.htm">printf</a>-style escape sequence (a <b>%</b> followed by <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>d</b>, etc.). For example, if <b>LESSBINFMT</b> is "<b>*u[%x]</b>", binary characters are displayed in underlined hexadecimal surrounded by brackets. The default if no <b>LESSBINFMT</b> is specified is "<b>*s&lt;%02X&gt;</b>". Warning: the result of expanding the character via <b>LESSBINFMT</b> must be less than 31 characters.</p>
<p class="tab">When the character set is <b>utf-8</b>, the <b>LESSUTFBINFMT</b> environment variable acts similarly to <b>LESSBINFMT</b> but it applies to Unicode code points that were successfully decoded but are unsuitable for display (e.g., unassigned code points). Its default value is "<b>&lt;U+%04lX&gt;</b>". Note that <b>LESSUTFBINFMT</b> and <b>LESSBINFMT</b> share their display attribute setting ("<b>*x</b>") so specifying one will affect both; <b>LESSUTFBINFMT</b> is read after <b>LESSBINFMT</b> so its setting, if any, will have priority. Problematic <a href="/jargon/o/octet.htm">octets</a> in a <b>UTF-8</b> file (octets of a truncated sequence, octets of a complete but non-shortest form sequence, illegal octets, and stray trailing octets) are displayed individually using <b>LESSBINFMT</b> so as to facilitate diagnostics of how the UTF-8 file is ill-formed.</p>

<li>The <b>-e</b> option works differently. If the <b>-e</b> option is not set, <b>less</b> behaves as if the <b>-E</b> option were set. If the <b>-e</b> option is set,<b>less</b>behaves as if the <b>-e</b> and <b>-F</b> options were set.</li>
<li>The <b>-m</b> option works differently. If the <b>-m</b> option is not set, the medium prompt is used, and it is prefixed with the string "<b>--More--</b>". If the <b>-m</b> option is set, the short prompt is used.</li>
<li>The <b>-n</b> option acts like the <b>-z</b> option. The normal behavior of the <b>-n</b> option is unavailable in this mode.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tab">The parameter to the <b>-p</b> option is taken to bea <b>less</b>command rather than a search pattern.</p>
<p class="tab">The <b>LESS</b> environment variable is ignored, and the <b>MORE</b> environment variable is used in its place.</p>
